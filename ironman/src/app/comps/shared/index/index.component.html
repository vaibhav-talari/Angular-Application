      <p class="text-center">Iron Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character
          was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don
          Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March
          1963).
          <br>
          <br> A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers
          a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass
          destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
          develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark
          Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first
          concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.
          <br>
          <br> Anthony Edward Stark is the adopted son of wealthy industrialist and head of Stark Industries, Howard
          Stark, and Maria Stark. A boy genius, he enters MIT at the age of 15 to study electrical engineering and
          later receives master's degrees in electrical engineering and physics. After his parents are killed in a
          car accident, he inherits his father's company. Stark is injured by a booby trap and captured by enemy forces
          led by Wong-Chu. Wong-Chu orders Stark to build weapons, but Stark's injuries are dire and shrapnel is moving
          towards his heart. His fellow prisoner, Ho Yinsen, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist whose work Stark had greatly
          admired during college, constructs a magnetic chest plate to keep the shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart.
          In secret, Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and construct a suit of powered armor, which Stark
          uses to escape. During the escape attempt, Yinsen sacrifices his life to save Stark's by distracting the
          enemy as Stark recharges. Stark takes revenge on his kidnappers and rejoins the American forces, on his way
          meeting a wounded American Marine fighter pilot, James "Rhodey" Rhodes.
          <br>
          <br> Back home, Stark discovers that the shrapnel fragment lodged in his chest cannot be removed without
          killing him, and he is forced to wear the armor's chestplate beneath his clothes to act as a regulator for
          his heart. He must recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing him. The cover story
          that Stark tells the news media and general public is that Iron Man is his robotic personal bodyguard, and
          corporate mascot. To that end, Iron Man fights threats to his company (e.g., Communist opponents Black Widow,
          the Crimson Dynamo, and the Titanium Man), as well as independent villains like the Mandarin (who becomes
          his greatest enemy). No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man, as he cultivates a strong public image of being
          a rich playboy and industrialist. Two notable members of the series' supporting cast, at this point, are
          his personal chauffeur Harold "Happy" Hogan, and secretary Virginia "Pepper" Pottsâ€”to both of whom he eventually
          reveals his dual identity. Meanwhile, James Rhodes finds his own niche as Stark's personal pilot, ultimately
          revealing himself to be a man of extraordinary skill and daring in his own right. The series took an anti-Communist
          stance in its early years, which was softened as public (and therefore, presumably, reader) opposition rose
          to the Vietnam War. This change evolved in a series of storylines featuring Stark reconsidering his political
          opinions, and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the U.S. military. Stark shows himself to be occasionally
          arrogant, and willing to act unethically in order to 'let the ends justify the means'. This leads to personal
          conflicts with the people around him, both in his civilian and superhero identities. Stark uses his vast
          personal fortune not only to outfit his own armor, but also to develop weapons for S.H.I.E.L.D.; other technologies
          (e.g., Quinjets used by the Avengers); and the image inducers used by the X-Men. Eventually, Stark's heart
          condition is resolved with an artificial heart transplant.
